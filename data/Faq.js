    ans: `                No. All tobacco products have risks but comparing hookah to
                  cigarettes is erroneous and misleading. Hookah is heated at a
                  temperature that is four times cooler than a burning cigarette
                  and creates an aerosol that is 75% water (60%) and glycerol
                  (15%). By contrast, cigarette smoke is 75% tar, carbon monoxide,
                  and nicotine . Most people enjoy hookah in moderation, far less
                  often than typical smokers light up a cigarette. In the United
                  States, for example, 90% of people who enjoy hookah do so no`,
