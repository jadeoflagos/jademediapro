                time to prepare and cannot be transported easily or used “on the

          The 80/20 Rule. You’re probably aware that 80 percent of your income
          is determined by 20 percent of your customers. If this isn't the case,
          you're probably missing out on a lot of profitable opportunities.
          What's really needed is a method to capture leads, convert those leads
          into small-time customers, and gradually build them towards customers
          that spend more with you.
          <br />
          <br /> Our consultation workshop will help you to understand, analyse,
          and prioritize your business market supplying a summary of typical
          strategies and implementation describing how your product or service
          will be sold, managing your customers' expectations, and how the plan
