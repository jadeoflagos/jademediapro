  `The authenticity of real painting cannot be overshadowed by digital art. Digital art no doubt has its juiciness but the originality and cultural background of painting leave people wanting more of it. Coloured pictorial representation of any drawing or picture requires much skill and because of this, most people have a hard time awarding artisan painting projects because it usually ends up becoming a scene of "what I ordered versus what I got."
