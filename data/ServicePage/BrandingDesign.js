export const BrandStrategy = [
  `Business can’t survive if it doesn’t have a strong brand strategy
  – a unified identity, personalized content communication,
  exceptional culture, core business mission, and values, etc.
  Usually misunderstood, brand strategy is just not your logo,
  colour palette, or website, despite the fact that these creative
  ingredients are essential to a successful branding strategy.`,
  `Our main goal is to let the world know that your brand exists,
    what purpose it has, what you stand for, the promise you make, the
    personality you convey, and what defines your brand. We bring your
    competitive positioning to life, help you communicate your brand
    personality and tone of voice more effectively with your
    customers, shape how they feel about your brand, and drive
    sustainable brand awareness and brand equity.`,

export const LogoBrandIdentity = [
  `
  Many business owners use logos and brands interchangeably, but
  this is incorrect because a logo on its own is not your brand. A
  logo is just a small but important piece of your brand and a key
  part of your brand’s identity. Logo design is not easy, it’s a
  skillful task that not only requires design skills but also proper
  research, expertise, and planning to arrive at a solid working
  concept.`,
  `We start with a deep analysis of your business purpose to
  understand who you are and how we can translate your essence into
  a visual language that effectively communicates your brand story.
  We make the first impression an everlasting impression by applying
  design principles to create a comprehensive logo and brand
  identity that is attractive, innovative, dynamic, cohesive, and
  promotes your brand integrity at all times in the real world.`,

export const ProductsBrandingPackaging = [
  `Many businesses are unaware that product design and branding are deeply connected. When a product is not planned, designed, created, marketed, and sold with the brand value at its core, it can sabotage its own success. Besides that, effective packaging not only ensures that the product is protected from damage but also ensures that it is presentable and attractive. Packaging is an effective way of marketing because it is the first thing customers view.
  `,
  `We design simple, clear concepts that catch your targeted customers, stir up emotions of excitement, joy, delight, or amazement, and encourage them to buy your product giving them no choice but to keep coming back to your brand. Because first impressions are so important, we develop a unique well-designed high-quality product packaging that appeals to your consumers and encourages them to pick up your product over and over again.

export const BrandCollateralDesign = [
  `Despite the sensational rise of digital marketing tools, brand collateral/stationery has not lost its conservative potency. Your brand's collateral is typically the first impression of your product or service, and first impressions matter. A poorly executed brand collateral/stationery design can do as much damage as a great professionally designed solution can do to enhance the perceived value of your offering and increase your sales. 
`,
  `We create brand collateral, which includes your business card, ID card, letterhead, invoice, envelope, PowerPoint/Keynote presentation, notepads, pens, T-shirt, face, cap, lanyard, calendar, organizer, stamp, sticker, label, packing tape, coffee mug, and other items that communicate your brand's core values and overall personality, in order to make sales promotion and marketing strategies easier and more effective.

export const CompanyProfileDesign = [
  `Without a well-designed company profile brochure, many businesses have failed to spread the word about all their various products, services, events, or the launch of a new product among others in an effective manner which is essential for their success and growth. Editorial designs allow the flow of information in and out of the company and indicate to everyone the direction of the company towards its mission using a strong visual identity.
`,
  `We help you engage with your customers through our effective company profiles and editorial designs using colours, illustrations, and layouts to better improve the distribution of your business goals and objectives to your customers. We focus on the layout of the flyer, brochure, newspaper, leaflet, catalogue, or magazine pages in order to standardize the print materials in an engaging way that captivates your customers' attention, entices them, engages them in processing the pages, and educates them through the publication as a whole.

export const EnvironmentalRetailGraphics = [
  `Many business owners today invest so much time, resources, and money on digital marketing and branding that they pay very little attention to their business's environmental visual design. They completely ignore their office because they failed to take into account the intent of their visitors/customers and how the design would affect their experience in that environment.
`,
  `We design business environments/workplaces that broaden perspectives, showcase new ideas, and inspire people to succeed and engage with your brand, whether it’s your employees or visitors. Our designers create large format graphics - the "wow" factor - from concept to installation, exploring striking visual ideas and crafting innovative solutions to transform your space or one-stop-shop into gorgeous and engaging models for your clients to experience your brand.

  `Our brains process images 60,000 times faster than words, yet the average human attention span is 8 seconds. Visual content is more effective than text-based marketing, according to 72 percent of marketers, and publishers who utilize infographics grow traffic 12 percent faster than those who don't.
