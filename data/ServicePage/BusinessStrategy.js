  "Most people when they think of creating a business offline or online, think of creating a product, selling the product, and hoping to make enough capital to finance their next product idea. This kind of thinking is short-term about what's hot for the next few months and concentrates on selling a product to fill that hot, but limited need and it's not beneficial to a long-term business venture.",

  `The 80/20 Rule. You’re probably aware that 80 percent of your
  income is determined by 20 percent of your customers. If this
  isn't the case, you're probably missing out on a lot of profitable
  opportunities. What's really needed is a method to capture leads,
  convert those leads into small-time customers, and gradually build
  them towards customers that spend more with you.
  `,
  `Our consultation workshop will help you to understand, analyse,
  and prioritize your business market supplying a summary of typical
  strategies and implementation describing how your product or
  service will be sold, managing your customers' expectations, and
  how the plan will be put into action together with its milestones
  to focus on a clear vision and achieve the anticipated growth.

  "A lot of businesses today spend so much time, resources, and money carrying out routine business activities that enable them to deliver on their value proposition, unaware of the fact that most of their routine business activities can be automated.

The danger of leaving it all to humans is that human error can be unpredictable and happen when you least expect it.",

  "Project failures are not only expensive but can have very negative consequences for the reputation of the company and the project team. About 60-80% of project failures can be attributed directly to poor requirements gathering, communications breakdown, analysis, and management.
